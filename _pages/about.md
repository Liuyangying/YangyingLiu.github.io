I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the [Computer Science and Engineering Department](https://engineering.lehigh.edu/cse) at [Lehigh University](https://www2.lehigh.edu/), working with [Dr. Brian Y. Chen](https://informatics.cas.lehigh.edu/) in the Informatics Lab.

Previously, I earned my second master's degree in Software Engineering in the Computer Science Department at California State University, Fullerton, and my first master's degree in Environmental Biology at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, where I was advised by Prof. Ye Deng.

My research primarily focuses on developing advanced machine learning algorithms for biological data (such as protein structure data and DNA sequence data). I aim to create explainable deep learning models that interpret the mechanisms underlying protein–ligand binding and protein–protein binding. In addition, I develop explainable deep learning models to identify microbial biomarkers from microbial DNA data that indicate different environmental conditions and to understand signature microbes in diverse environments, including soils, waters, air, and animal gut microbiomes.
